# TEM-Sample-Holder-Fabrication
## Overview
This repository reports the fabrication and characterization of a **Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) sample holder** performed as part of the course Materials Science & Engineering 121L at UCLA.

The project includes the following fabrication techqniues:
- LPCVD silicon nitride deposition
- Photolithography with positive photoresist
- Reactive Ion Etching (RIE)
- Anisotropic wet etching of silicon
- X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) for thin-film thickness analysis

## Fabrication Workflow
1. Silicon wafer cleaning and dehydration bake  
2. LPCVD silicon nitride deposition  
3. Spin coating AZ 5214-EIR photoresist  
4. UV lithography and development  
5. Dry etching of silicon nitride (RIE)  
6. Anisotropic wet etching of silicon (with NaOH)  
7. Optical microscopy inspection  
8. XRR analysis for nitride thickness  

## Key Results
- **Silicon etch depth (tSi):** calculated using anisotropic etch geometry  
- **Percent yield:** ranged from ~94% to 132%, indicating over-etching and process non-uniformity  
- **Nitride thickness:** ~105 nm determined from XRR fringe spacing  
- Identified sources of error: contamination, mask print quality, extended etch time
